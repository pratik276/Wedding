            <h3>Our Story</h3>
            <p>
              On February 13, 2021, the air was crisp and the night felt alive.
              He was out with his friends, celebrating a special moment at a
              hilltop farmhouse. The laughter echoed across the open skies, the
              music blending with the crackling of the bonfire, but somewhere
              deep within, there was a void. As much as he enjoyed the company,
              he couldn't shake the feeling that something was missing in his
              life. He yearned for someone special, someone whose presence could
              fill the silence he often felt after the noise faded. That night,
              as he gazed out into the vast horizon, he quietly wished for
              someone who would sing to his heart.
            </p>
            <p>
              Miles away, she lay at home, her dreams swirling in the stillness
              of the night. She had always been a dreamer, picturing a world
              where everything fell into place as if destiny had written it.
              That night, her dreams were vivid, but she had no idea that her
              life was about to take a turn she had only imagined.
            </p>
            <p>
              The next day, February 14, 2021, the day of love, he returned
              home, the warmth of the farmhouse fading into memories. With
              Valentine's Day all around, the desire for companionship stirred
              within him stronger than ever. He wished he could find a
              girl—someone who would not only understand him but sing for him,
              filling his life with melody.
            </p>
            <p>
              As fate would have it, that very day, she was returning to her
              hostel. Her father was driving her, and though her mind was
              wandering, something magical was about to happen. A chat started
              between them, a simple exchange that felt anything but ordinary.
              It was as if the gods had finally answered his wish. She, sweet
              and gentle, took the time to chat with him, despite being on the
              road with her dad. What began as casual conversation quickly
              turned into something more. It was as though they had been waiting
              for each other without even knowing it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Both of them, though content in their lives, had been yearning for
              something deeper, something to bring them joy. And in each other,
              they found exactly that. They began to look forward to the day
              they would meet. Though the days passed slowly, there was always a
              sense of excitement in the air, a shared hope that they would soon
              be face to face.
            </p>
            <p>
              And then, that moment arrived. When they finally met, it felt like
              the missing pieces of their lives had come together. There was no
              looking back from that day onward. In their ups and downs, they
              stood by each other, becoming pillars of strength and support.
              Whether it was the small struggles of daily life or the daunting
              task of convincing their parents to agree to their marriage, they
              faced it all, hand in hand.
            </p>
            <p>
              Their love was tested, but never broken. And with all the twists
              and turns, they finally reached the day that had seemed so
              distant. On February 13, 2025, exactly four years from the day he
              had stood on that hilltop farmhouse and wished for someone like
              her, they will finally get married. It was as though the universe
              had conspired to bring them together, and now, as they prepare to
              step into the next chapter of their lives, they do so knowing that
              they were always meant to be.
            </p>
            <p>
              From a simple chat on a Valentine’s Day to a love that withstood
              every challenge, their story is one of serendipity, struggle, and
              joy. A story that began with a wish under the stars, and now, with
              the same stars as their witnesses, they will say their vows,
              sealing a love that was written in the stars all along.
            </p>
            <p>
              On February 13, 2025—four years to the day he made that silent
              wish—Ashma will be getting married to Pratik.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is our story: one of serendipity, love, and a future that’s
              just beginning.
